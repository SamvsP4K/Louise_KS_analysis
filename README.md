## An Analysis of Play/Theater Kickstarter Campaigns 

This analysis was made to compare the theater and play category of Kickstarter campaigns and how different campaigns have done based on their launch dates and outcome goals. Louise is using this information for her future crowdfunding projects in this category. 

#### Outcomes vs Launch Date:

We were given Kickstarter data that included many categories like music, technology, and television. The data was organzied and filtered so information on plays and theaters were more easily seen. A pivot chart based on launch date outcomes was created according to filtered data from the Main Sheet. The line chart created based on the pivot chart information is as follows.

It is clear from this chart that the most successful theater/play outcomes were in May and June. May was the highest month with 111 successful campaigns out of a total 166. In general, we can see that a larger portion of campaigns in this category were successful. Based on information on our pivot chart, which is included in the excel file, 839 out 1369 theater/play campaigns reached their funding goals making that around 61% for the whole year.

#### Outcomes vs Goal:

When I took in information for outcomes based on funding goals, I created a new speadsheet using a countif formula to separate campaigns based on the value of their funding goal. The values can be seen on the X axis on the chart below along with the outcomes.

The largest percentage of successful campaigns were less than $1000 making that around 76%. An interesting point to be considered is the rise in success rates after a significant dip. At the $35,000 - $44,999 range we can see the success rate for campaigns rise above the 50% mark again. One of the limitations in the data that I found is that there is no research around marketing for any of the campaigns. This is a huge factor in what plays into the full funding of a campaign put on Kickstarter, because of this one could falsely assume that success and failure in funding is soley based on funding goals. 

####Conclusion 

Louise would have a good chance in having a succssful cammpaign for a future project if held in around May or June and with a funding goal of about $5,000 or less. Considerations should be made based on proper marketing and online followings. If the project has a large online following or a strong marketing team there could be some success in a larger funding goal.
