## A Analysis of Play/Theater Kickstarter Campaigns 

This analysis was made to compare the theater and play category of kickstarter campaigns and how different campaigns have done based on their launch dates and outcome goals. Louise is using this information to consider for her future crowdfunding projects in this category. 

We were given kickstarter data that included many categories like music, technology, and television. The data was organzied and filtered so information on plays and theaters were more easily seen. A pivot chart based on launch date outcomes was created based on filtered data from the Main Sheet.
